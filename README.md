# Portfolio Website

A website built in React to show my projects, CV and other things.


MVP:
- Add a brief description
- Links to websites
- Can see my CV - Eventually move to a pdf viewer.
- Email address is shown.


ToDo:
- Links currently untested.
- DRY projects page
- DRY css
- Split Css file
- Make page responsive
- When clicking a link and then returning back to the page, the page is not recognized. Believe I need to add the route to netlify.
